# google-code-in_2018

### Overview

This is my first time to participate in [Google
Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) Contest. It was pretty good but
also challenging since I only leanred programming for five month.
Although I enter a week late because I didn't get the info, I still
finished with 15 completed tasks. Most of my tasks are from
[Wikimedia](https://www.wikimedia.org/). I tried
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/). And I
coded some piano pieces with LilyPond, and the piano pieces I made are
posted on Wikipedia pages. There are more details below.

#### Achievement

### Tasks Completed

#### Lua 1-6

Lua task one through six are easy beginner tasks which required to write
simple algorithms to complete the tasks. Thus, I will only explain a
little bit of the algorithms.

-   **lua1:**a function to print out 'hello world'. However, it did take
    me a while to set up a wikimedia account to run the program. You
    need a wiki page to write the functions and a module sandbox to
    activiate the function

-   **lua2:**Create HI function for printing out a name passing to the
    function.

-   **lua3:**Create temperature function to convert Celsius to
    Fahrenheit.

-   **lua4:**Starting from task4, the tasks begins to require the
    control structures like `if, while, repeat, for`, but task 4 itself
    was simply amending their code.

-   **lua5:**Introduce to lua library and pattern matching, amend code
    with `string.sub(str, index)` & `string.match(str, pattern)`
    methods.

-   **lua6:**Experience with the lua language library, which involves
    function of getting `langnames(language names)` and
    `langcode(language code)`. For exmaple, Chinese's language code is
    `ch`, and the library provides callback funtion to get language name
    from langauge code.

#### Lua 7

Problem Description

> This task requires you to create your own function which can take text
> such as may be found in the first column and an optional format
> parameter. It will output a date either in the requested format or in
> a format matching that of the text supplied -
